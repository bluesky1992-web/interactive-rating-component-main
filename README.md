### What I learned

From this code, here are a few key things you can learn as someone learning JavaScript:

1. Selecting DOM elements: The code demonstrates how to select HTML elements using `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`. This is useful for accessing and manipulating elements in the DOM.

2. Event handling: The code shows how to handle events using event listeners. In this case, the `click` event is used for the submit button and the window's `click` event. Event listeners allow you to execute specific code when an event occurs.

3. Conditionals: The code uses conditional statements (`if`) to check if a rating is selected or if a click event occurred outside the modal. Conditionals are fundamental in programming and allow you to make decisions based on certain conditions.

4. DOM manipulation: The code demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM by changing the style properties of elements. This includes hiding and showing elements by modifying the `display` and `visibility` CSS properties.

5. Preventing default behavior: The code utilizes `e.preventDefault()` to prevent the default form submission behavior when no rating is selected. This showcases how to control and modify default behavior using JavaScript.

6. Text content manipulation: The code updates the text content of an element using the `textContent` property. This is useful for dynamically changing the content of elements based on user interactions or other events.
